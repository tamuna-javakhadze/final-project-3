            "title": "Epithelial tissue",
            "description": "Epithelial tissue forms the outer layer of body surfaces and lines internal cavities and organs. It is categorized by cell shape (squamous, cuboidal, columnar) and layer arrangement (simple, stratified, pseudostratified). Epithelia serve various functions including protection, absorption, secretion, and filtration. They are avascular but supported by an underlying basement membrane, which separates them from connective tissue. Specialized junctions like tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions enable cells to function cohesively."
